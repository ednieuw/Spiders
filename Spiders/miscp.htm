<H3>Klaverjas </H3>
<DL>
<DT>This program was made to play klaverjas against the computer. I played it a lot on holidays and thought it was nice to make a computer version of the game. </DT>
<DD>A lot of time was spent to recall the statistics to calculate the odds that the opponent had a card (e.g. 10 clubs) in his hand. We were on holiday and had no books.<BR>
After buying a calculator, that could calculate factorials, the formulae was found and called Guilermie, after the village near Vichy in France where we were camping.<BR>
The cards were designed on paper with millimeter squares with colored pencils and eventually the holiday was over.<BR>
Making the program was not as easy as I initially thought, but after several months the program worked and here is the result. <BR>
The game is a typical Dutch game but the rules may be found in specialized card game books.<BR>
Normally the game is played with four players.<BR>
The cards of the third and the fourth player are laid down on the table, four open and four closed.<BR>
The cards first played may be from the table or the hand, the second card, played by the opponent, must be played from the table. So you are playing for yourself and the third person. The computer plays the opponent and the fourth player. I should spend some time to write down the rules in English. If you are really interested E-mail me.<BR>
