<H3>The stat matrix page</H3>
<P>From this page you can download a stat matrix program written for Windows 3.1 and higher.<BR>
The statistical program calculates parametric and non parametric statistics between test data.<BR>
Data are read in from a Lotus .WKS or .WK1 worksheet. The first row should contain the test name of the test and below the test data should be entered.<BR>
The program calculates weighted linear regression coefficients, pearson- and spearman rank- correlation and paired Wilcoxon and t-test or non paired t-test and Mann-Whitney U and their significance's p. The statistics are checked against the SPSS statistical package. <BR>
The program has a feature "Calc all". It then calculates all statistics between all columns. One should keep in mind that by doing statistics in this way a high (or low) correlation may be found by change between to tests. The tests should be repeated to confirm this incidence.<BR>
The program draws graphs and makes Lotus PIC graph files that can be edited in, by example, Paintshop Pro and the program PICdump that can also be downloaded.<BR>
