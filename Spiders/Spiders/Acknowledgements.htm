<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>
<p class=MsoNoSpacing>This  internet site displaying spiders from Europe and Australia was started in 1996. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The start of this new hobby was encouraged by members of
the British Arachnology Society (BAS) and the Belgium Werkgroep Inheemse
Spinnen (WIS).</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Craig Slawson</b> (Council member of the British Arachnological
Society) who carefully read the first web pages in February 1997 gave me with <b>Paul
Selden</b> some valuable basic suggestions about spiders. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>I would like to acknowledge <b>Bryan Goethals</b> for
providing me with some translated excerpts from his publications in the
journals of WIS (Werkgroep Inheemse Spinnen) as well as for several corrections
suggested by him, <b>Vinay Koshte</b> , <b>Gie Wyckmans</b>, <b>Herman
Vanuytven</b> and <b>Luc Vanhercke</b>.<br>
<b>Heiko Metzner</b> regularly mailed me with suggestions and his internet site
is well-known.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Yvan Montardi</b> started a salticid site in the
beginning of this millennium and due to him many jumping spiders could be given
a name</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Lars Bruun</b> checked the European wolf spiders in
2000 and <b>Arno Grabolle</b> checked my site on errors in 2010 and I am
obliged they did so.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Koen van Keer</b> is always enthusiastic in the
determination of difficult spiders and he is often helped by his brother <b>Johan
van Keer</b>.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Leo de Cooman</b> translated some pages in Esperanto
and together we could calculate the force and required diameter of a spider
thread trying to stop a Boeing in full flight </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The last years many spiders sites pop-up in Europe. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jørgen Lissner</b>’s<b> </b> site is becoming a
valuable site for identification of European spiders.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jerzy Proszynski</b> identified many Australian and
European salticids and started in the start of this millennium a giant
salticids internet site.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>With <b>Glenda Crew</b> I started separately internet pages
about Australian spider somewhere around 1997. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Several years later <b>Ron Atkinson</b> added an
impressive Australian spider site and due with help of these sites I was able
to identify my unknowns. </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>The Australian site was impossible with the help of
members of the Australian arachnology society. <b>Volker Framenau</b>, <b>Mark
Harvey</b> and<b> Juliana Waldock</b> are often helping me with identifications.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><b>Jurgen Otto</b> and <b>Robert Whyte</b> contributed
many pictures from the Eastern site of Australia and <b>Wendy Eiby</b> and <b>Fahran
Bokhari</b> roamed the Western site of Australia and <b>Michael Barritt</b> the
Centre and lately the North </p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing><strong>Robert Whyte</strong>’s internet site is growing fast with the
help of <b>Greg Anderson</b> and <b>Martin Stevens</b> and with the cooperation
of them many pictures were added to my site.<br>
Several of the Australian Mygalomorphs  were photographed and donated by <b>Colin
Halliday</b> and since then many visitors were attracted by this infamous
spiders.</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>And of course my spider companion <b>Ronald Loggen</b> is
invaluable in locating spiders while I am photographing his previous finding and 
programming the Access database to manage the pictures</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNoSpacing>Wikipedia is growing fast and Flikcr also show many
spider pictures. Let’s hope these sites do not kill the personal initiatives
that give some flavour to the internet.</p>
